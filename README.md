# Warning


⚠️ Multicoder is currently in preview! Things might break but that’s how you know it’s fresh.  
Stay tuned for the public release, and I'm willing to move the project from websockets to [WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/).

# Multicoder

> Real-time collaborative code editor – fast, light, and built from scratch.

**Multicoder** is a high-performance, low-bandwidth collaborative code editor where multiple programmers can join a room and write code together in real time. Designed for speed and efficiency, it's crafted from the ground up with a custom file system, bundler, and blazing fast WebSocket communication.

## Features

- **Real-time collaboration** Code together in the same file with near-zero latency.
- **Custom bundler** Fully homemade module system tailored for speed and simplicity.
- **Custom file system** Lightweight and efficient, optimized for collaborative editing.
- **WebSocket-based** Minimal bandwidth usage with a blazing fast messaging layer.
- **Modular and hackable** Built to be extended and improved as the project evolves.

## Why Multicoder?

Most collaborative editors are heavy, complex, or built on top of bloated systems. **Multicoder** is different:

- Built from scratch every line of code is handcrafted.
- Minimalist and efficient ideal even for spotty internet connections.
- A platform for experimentation perfect for hackers, educators, and remote teams.
